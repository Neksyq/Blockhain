# Simple Blockchain with Node.js

This project is a basic implementation of a blockchain using Node.js. It demonstrates essential blockchain concepts such as blocks, cryptographic hashes, proof of work, and chain validation.

## Features

- **Block creation**: Blocks store data like transaction information.
- **Proof of work**: Ensures that each block's hash meets a set difficulty level.
- **Blockchain validation**: Verifies the integrity of the entire chain.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
- `crypto-js` library for generating SHA256 hashes.
